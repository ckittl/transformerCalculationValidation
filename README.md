# Transformer Calculation Validation

As part of my Ph.D. thesis work I'd like to compare and validate transformer calculations
of [ieÂ³'s](https://github.com/ie3-institute) internal behavior oriented and agent based simulation tool SIMONA against
the well known and recognized simulation tools [pandapower](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower)
and [DIgSILENT PowerFactory](https://www.digsilent.de/en/powerfactory.html).

This repository aims in supplying scripts and models to obtain comparative calculations as well as means to evaluate the
results.
